We are focusing our efforts in determining the trends of Type II Diabetes or Diabetes Mellitus since this is closely linked to lifestyle habits, eating patterns, and obesity. We have left out Gestational Diabetes since this is an unreliable factor in understanding diabetic trends since it’s limited to the time when a woman is pregnant and might or might not recur. 
For our analyses, we focused on the survey question that determined whether the participant was already diagnosed with Diabetes. We also focused on participants that were borderline diabetic and/or were watching their sugar intake. We analyzed these participants as “Pre-Diabetic” and used this measure as a way to understand how unchecked diabetes might affect the current already heavy burden of diabetes on the state.
