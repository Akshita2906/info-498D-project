Access to health care plays an important role in the success of public health initiatives. The US has a fairly good system of access to health care facilities, and despite the lack of universal healthcare, has a rather high percentage of people who are insured under a health plan. So, we focused on picking out states which have the lowest rates of reported good health and lowest enrolments in health plans to understand how which might be regions which need improvements in their current infrastructure to ensure better access to facilities. Since, lifestyle and health changes are contingent on promoting and spreading awareness, the presence of qualified professionals and access to a medical facility for proper attention to serious diseases and medication is an important factor that needs to be considered.
