If we analyze population that is “pre-diabetic”, we see that this is on almost equal terms with the percentage of the population that is diagnosed with Diabetes already thus effectively doubling the burden of Diabetic patients on the system. There are also some common states between the Diabetic and Pre-Diabetic ones like Puerto Rico, West Virginia, Virgin Islands etc. thus, effectively, putting them at double the risk with incoming diabetes patients as well.
