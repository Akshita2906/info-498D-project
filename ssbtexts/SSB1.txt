There has been a raging debate about how the dominance of sugar and sugary beverages are contributing to the growth of noncommunicable epidemics. Sugary drinks such as soft drinks, energy drinks, sweetened teas, and sport drinks offer little or no nutritional value, but massive quantities of added sugar. In the setting of a pandemic of obesity and related chronic diseases, the American Heart Association recently released a scientific statement recommending reductions in added sugar intake to no more than 100-150 kcal per day for most Americans. The statement identified sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) as the primary source of added sugars in the American diet. While it has long been suspected that SSBs contribute at least in part to the obesity epidemic, only in recent years have large epidemiologic studies been able to substantiate the relationship between SSB consumption and long-term weight gain, Type II Diabetes Mellitus and cardiovascular risk. It is thought that SSB’s contribute to weight gain due to their high added sugar content, low satiety and potential incomplete compensation for total energy leading to increased energy intake (Malik, Popkin, Bray, & Jean-Pierre Després, 2010)
