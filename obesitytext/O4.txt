As can be seen from the graphs above, the percentage of obese men in these states exceeds the percentage of women. These are alarming statistics because around 75% of the population has a BMI > 25 which puts them at a high risk of heart-disease, diabetes, and other lifestyle related risks. 
If we drill down further to look at specific sections of the society who might be more affected and hence need immediate preventive initiatives directed towards them. We can see from the demographic split above that Black - Non-Hispanic populations seem to be most highly affected especially in Mississippi which is the state with the highest percentage of obese population. This is mirrored in West Virginia which is second on the list. This trend continues for the next four states on the list. 
Thus, a public health initiative to promote healthy eating, regular exercise and portion control should be raised by the states of Mississippi, Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Iowa, Nebraska and Texas.
