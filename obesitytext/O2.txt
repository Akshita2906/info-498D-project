Obesity is a public health problem that has become epidemic worldwide. Substantial literature has emerged to show that overweight and obesity are major causes of co-morbidities, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, various cancers and other health problems, which can lead to further morbidity and mortality. The related health care costs are also substantial. Therefore, a public health approach to develop population-based strategies for the prevention of excess weight gain is of great importance. However, public health intervention programs have had limited success in tackling the rising prevalence of obesity. 
For the purpose of our research, the survey question we focused on was – “Is the BMI for this adult greater than 25?”. Since it’s common for individuals to underreport their weight, we can safely assume that we have covered most people who might be classified as obese or borderline obese.
