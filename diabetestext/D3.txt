We can see that Alabama leads the list of states with highest percentage of population diagnosed with Diabetes Type II. An interesting insight is that Females seem to be afflicted more with this disease than males – this might be influenced by the fact that hormonal changes in a woman’s body after her menopause puts her at a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and depression. 
If we look at how demographics or race affects the prevalence of diabetes, we can observe from the graphs that there is a very diverse variation of demographics. We see some states with a leading value in the Black-Non-Hispanic population and others with the Multiracial – Non-Hispanic population. However, Puerto Rico seems to stand out with the multi-racial population posting a high 100% in diabetes prevalence. This seems to be a flaw in the weighing system that we have incorporated since it accounts for race-wise and state wise weighing and considering the small size of Puerto Rico and the smaller size of the multiracial community there, this number might be an exaggerated estimate of actual values.
