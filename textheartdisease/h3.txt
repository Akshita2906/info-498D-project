We focused on survey questions that asked the participant whether they had been diagnosed for any of the three components of heart disease by a qualified medical professional. We picked the variable that accounted for all three of these conditions. The burden of this disease is mostly limited to the older age group and seems to affect men more than women as is expressed by the graph below. Out of all states, West Virginia leads the list of states with the highest prevalence of diagnosed heart disease. 
If we look at the demographic breakdown of the prevalence of heart disease in the population of states with the highest incidence of heart disease, we see that multiracial groups seem to be at a higher risk as can be seen for the states of Arkansas, West Virginia, and Kentucky. Most other states have an equivalent split between the Black and the Hispanic population. The population of people at highest risk after the multiracial population seem to be White Non-Hispanics which have a leading prevalence of heart disease in almost all states.
