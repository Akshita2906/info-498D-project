This brings us to the question, over a large and diverse country such as the United States, are there certain areas which are more afflicted by these issues and hence require more immediate and stronger public health interventions and preventive measures. With the burgeoning trend of faulty eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle, heart disease, diabetes and obesity are being termed as 'silent killers' that plague our generation and are the top 10 burdens in the US and many other middle and high-income countries. We attempt to present our research to draw a comparative analysis between the "health" of these states in comparison to one another and to the national average to understand which region might be the one which needs an immediate implementation of strong preventive/reactive measures to reduce the burden of these diseases. This research can be analyzed by health officials on a national level to understand on a comparative basis how each region is faring in terms of risk factors and disease prevalence
