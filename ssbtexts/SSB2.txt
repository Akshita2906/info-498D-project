 Epidemiological studies have finally succeeded in proving that sugar sweetened beverages adversely affect the human body and lead to numerous health implications including obesity, diabetes, heart disease and impaired liver and kidney function. For our analyses, we focused on two variables that measure the intake of sugar sweetened soda and sugar sweetened fruit beverages – these drinks exclude any kind of diet soda or beverages with sweeteners other than sugar, fructose syrup and similar sweeteners. The results of these questions were recorded as number of drinks consumed daily, weekly or monthly. We wrangled the data to convert all these measures into a uniform weekly measure for effective scaling. However, a primary limitation that we have faced while trying to assimilate and wrangle data to determine trends of sugar sweetened beverage consumption was that most of this data even under the BRFSS is not public and available which resulted in us accessing data of only 7 states through the BRFSS survey results.
