For our analyses, we narrowed down on states which had the lowest rates of the population’s self-reported scores of “good health”. As we can see Arkansas fairs the lowest at around 75%. There doesn’t seem to be a very noticeable variation in demographics with an almost equal split between the five with an exception for Puerto Rico which reports some mismatched data which again can be traced back to the flaws of weighing a small community. 
If we look further on to people with access to a health plan, we see that there is a glaring lack of access to health care due to non enrolment in health plans in the Hispanic populations in almost all the worst faring states. This could be an insight that state governments could look into. Considering that the Hispanic population is already at a greater risk of Obesity and Heart Disease as seen in our previous analyses, their access to health care and affordable treatment could drastically bring about a change in the numbers for other linked diseases as well
