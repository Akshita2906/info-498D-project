## Introduction:
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) cause more than two-thirds (70%, around 40 million) of all annual deaths and are among the leading causes of preventable illness and related disability. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes account for more than 80% of these deaths (WHO, n.d.).The growing burden of NCDs also exacts an economic cost, as people are less productive, work for fewer years, and die prematurely. If the current trend continues, NCDs are estimated to cause a cumulative loss of output of $47 trillion between 2011 and 2030 (Bloom, Sept. 2011.). Ischemic Heart Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease and Diabetes have been a consistent presence in the top 10 causes of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in the 2005-2016-year bracket (Institue for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2016). The primary risk factors contributing to these DALYs are all issues linked to a poor lifestyle and eating habits such as high body mass index, dietary risks, high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc. with high body mass index as the leading cause (Institue for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2016). 
This brings us to the question, over a large and diverse country such as the United States, are there certain areas which are more afflicted by these issues and hence require more immediate and stronger public health interventions and preventive measures. 
 

## Existing Research:



## Data:
For the purposes of this research, we used the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) Dataset for the year 2016. Because of the extensive nature of the BRFSS questionnaire, we have utilized various parts of the data to narrow down on risk factors and pertinent data related to noncommunicable diseases of interest. The rationale behind choosing these specific factors was linked to the burgeoning upward trend in the prevalence of these disease. We will pay special attention to the weighing of variables -  keeping in mind the survey weights listed by the BRFSS in the dataset and how they apply to our data. We will be looking into primarily the following factors of interest:
1. Cardiovascular Disease
2. Diabetes and Prediabetes
3. Obesity 
4. Consumption of Sugar Sweetened Beverages
5. Access to health care and literacy 

## Audience:
With the burgeoning trend of faulty eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle, heart disease, diabetes and obesity are being termed as 'silent killers' that plague our generation and are seen as the top 10 burdens in the US and many other middle and high income countries. We attempt to present our research to draw a comparative analysis between the "health" of these states in comparison to one another and to the national average to understand which region might be the one which needs an immediate implementaion of strong preventive/reactive measures to reduce the burden of these diseases.
This research can be analysed by health officials on a national level to understand on a comparative basis how wach region is faring in terms of risk factors and disease prevalence


## Questions:
Pertinent questions that we attempt to answer with this exploratory analysis is 
1. Analyzing the trends of noncommunicable diseases linked to lifestyle and eating behavior in the US
2. Analyzing the risk factors and trend of disease prevalence in each state of the US
3. Exploring how race and sex play a role in the  prevalence of these diseases in every state

Further we aim to suggest preventive public health initiatives for the states that are at highest risk for noncommunicable diseases linked to lifestyle and eating habits
 
## Technical Description:

The final product will be an interactive online resource compiled using Shiney App in R. For the purposes of this research, we used the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) Dataset for the year 2016. Because of the extensive nature of the BRFSS questionnaire, we have utilized various parts of the data to narrow down on risk factors and pertinent data related to noncommunicable diseases of interest. The rationale behind choosing these specific factors was linked to the burgeoning upward trend in the prevalence of these disease. We will pay special attention to the weighing of variables
Since neither of us have any experience in working with RShiny, one of our goals will also be to understand and express our findings appropriately in RShiny. Similarly, coming in with no experience of Interactive Visualization in R, we would also want to explore plotly and crosstalk in R to create interactive visualizations if time premits.
