Out of the analyzed states, New Jersey seems to lead with almost 12 SSB drinks consumed per week on an average. From the graphs below we can draw primarily two succinct insights. First, the number of sugar sweetened drinks consumed by men on an average in a week is more than those consumed in the same amount of time by women. This trend seems to be followed in most states – and is very pronounced in the states of Delaware and Iowa where men seem to consume almost double the number of drinks per week than women. Secondly, if we look at how demographics play out for these states, we see a high incidence of multiracial groups in NJ consuming these beverages. However, this is not a pattern that repeats in the other states with a similar intensity however, it does seem to be on an upward trend. The second demographic that stands out is the Black-Non-Hispanic section of the population. However, with data of only 7 states to analyze, there is a chance that our estimates and analyses might not be accurate considering the lack of adequate data.
