METHODOLOGY:
BRFSS Data has rich detail on every participant’s health status wherein we can track and understand trends of the above risk factors with reference to one another. Questions asked in the survey for these chronic health indicators were (mostly) simple yes-no answers. These can then be analyzed to check what percentage of the population actually has been diagnosed with these symptoms or suffers from indicators. However, just taking a mean of all responses is a crude way of determining the true condition. When data is used without weights, each record counts the same as any other record-and this implies the following assumptions:
•	Each record has equal probabilities of being selected.
•	Noncoverage and nonresponse are equal among all segments of the population
(BRFSS, n.d.). During data collection, the conditions that actually happen may be different than the preceding assumptions, and the differences can become large enough to affect the results of the data set. Weighting each record appropriately can help to adjust for these differences (or assumption violations). Thus, the BRFSS survey appropriately weights the variables accounting for all these factors using various calculated variables such as geographic strata, density strata, age etc. This final weight is calculated and is used to weigh all variables correspondingly. We have weighed all our variables as per the final calculated weight specified by the BRFSS.
Our methodology to understand these trends on a statewide basis started with identification of variables pertinent to each health condition and risk factor. On identification of the variables of our choice, we segregated them into categories based on the above. We followed this up with analyzing weighted cumulative national averages for each condition and comparing these with reference to each other. We then broke down these individual conditions into their state-wise components with appropriate weighting by creating survey designs. To further analyze conditions and to understand trends on a demographic level, created survey designs to categorize each variable into races and genders in each state with appropriate weighting. This gave a comprehensive picture about the above risk factors and health conditions in all the states with a flexible level of granularity
