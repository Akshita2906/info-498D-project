Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) cause more than two-thirds (70%, around 40 million) of all annual deaths and are among the leading causes of preventable illness and related disability. Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes account for more than 80% of these deaths (WHO, n.d.).The growing burden of NCDs also exacts an economic cost, as people are less productive, work for fewer years, and die prematurely. If the current trend continues, NCDs are estimated to cause a cumulative loss of output of $47 trillion between 2011 and 2030 (Bloom, Sept. 2011.). Ischemic Heart Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease and Diabetes have been a consistent presence in the top 10 causes of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in the 2005-2016-year bracket (Institue for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2016). The primary risk factors contributing to these DALYs are all issues linked to a poor lifestyle and eating habits such as high body mass index, dietary risks, high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc. with high body mass index as the leading cause (Institue for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2016).
