Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past three decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. An estimated 23.1 million people in the United States are diagnosed with diabetes at a cost of more than $245 billion per year. The CDC estimates that another 7.2 million people have diabetes but remain undiagnosed, while another 84.1 million adults 18 years and older have prediabetes. (NIH, n.d.). Individuals with diabetes are at greater risk than other similar adults for many common problems, including coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, depression, pain, polypharmacy, and functional disability. Despite significant advances in therapy over the past several years, diabetes remains the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (NIH, n.d.). However, under current models of care, many individuals with diabetes are not achieving the targets for optimal care recommended by clinical experts. Prediabetes occurs when the blood sugar level is higher than normal but not yet high enough to be type 2 diabetes. Without lifestyle changes, people with prediabetes are very likely to progress to type 2 diabetes. The exact cause of prediabetes could be family history and genetics that appear to play an important role. Inactivity and excess fat — especially abdominal fat — also seem to be important factors.
